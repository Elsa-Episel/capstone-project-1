<h1>Some of my Hobbies</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Basketball</li>
    <p>
        Basketball is my favourite hobby because I've been playing it for so long, have made great friends playing it, and the speed of the game, playing with others, and scoring and assisting is exhilarating.
    </p>
    <li>Video Games</li>
    <p>
        Video games are my second favourite hobby as I have been playing them my whole life, and they allow me to explore, learn, and adventure in ways I can't in real life. They give me freedom to do what I want and allow me to be a kid.

    <li>IT and Learning</li>
    <p>
        Techology and learning is my third favourite hobby and it's linked to my love of video games. I got into technology because I've loved video games ever since I was a kid. I've wanted to create my own video games, build my own machines, and see what I can create in general. I love learning new things and I will always strive to learn as much as I can for as long as I live.
